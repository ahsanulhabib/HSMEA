function [PRESSRMS, eXV, yhatXV, predvarXV, srgtSRGTXV, srgtOPTXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(srgtOPT, kfolds, idxFolds)
%Function srgtsCrossValidation computes cross-validation measures for the
%given surrogate models. Thus, for example:
%
%     PRESSRMS = srgtsCrossValidation(OPTIONS): returns a 1 x 1 vector of
%     PRESSRMS value for each surrogate, which is given by:
%
%     PRESSRMS = sqrt ( PRESS / NBPOINTS );
%
%     where:
%         * PRESS (Prediction Sum of Squares): PRESS = (eXV.')*eXV
%         * OPTIONS is the SURROGATES Toolbox option structure given by
%           srgtsOptionSet, and SURROGATE is the respective surrogate
%           structure.
%
%     PRESSRMS = srgtsCrossValidation(OPTIONS, KFOLDS, IDXFOLDS):
%     does the computation of the cross-validation errors using k-fold
%     strategy. KFOLDS is the number of folds and IDXFOLDS is the vector of
%     indexes organized for NBPOINTS/k clusters. IDXFOLDS is obtained using
%     srgtsGetKfolds.
%
%     [PRESSRMS, eXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(...):
%     also returns a NBPOINTS-by-NBSURROGATES  matrix with the
%     cross-validation errors. Here the cross-validation errors obtained
%     when one data point is ignored and the surrogate is fitted to the
%     other (NBPOINTS - 1) points, with the procedure repeated for each
%     data point. In a point, the cross-validation error is:
%
%     eXV = Yhat - Y;
%
%     where Yhat is the value evaluated with the surrogate and Y is the
%     actual value of the function.
%
%     [PRESSRMS, eXV, yhatXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(...):
%     also returns the NBPOINTS-by-NBSURROGATES matrix of cross-validation
%     prediction.
%
%     [PRESSRMS, eXV, yhatXV, predvarXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(...):
%     also returns the NBPOINTS-by-NBSURROGATES matrix of cross-validation
%     prediction variance (prediction variance is implemented only for KRG
%     and PRS models; for all others it is going to be NaN).
%
%     [PRESSRMS, eXV, yhatXV, predvarXV, srgtSRGTXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(...):
%     also returns all SURROGATES created during cross-validation.
%
%     [PRESSRMS, eXV, yhatXV, predvarXV, srgtSRGTXV, ...
%     srgtOPTXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(...): also returns all
%     OPTION structures created during cross-validation.
%
%Example:
%     % basic information about the problem
%     myFN = @cos; % this could be any user-defined function
%     designspace = [0;     % lower bound
%                    2*pi]; % upper bound
%
%     % create DOE
%     NbPoints = 5;
%     X = linspace(designspace(1), designspace(2), NbPoints)';
%     Y = feval(myFN, X);
%
%     % fit surrogate models
%     srgtOPT = srgtsPRSSetOptions(X, Y);
%
%     % calculate cross validation errors, and PRESSRMS
%     [PRESSRMS, eXV] = srgtsCrossValidation(srgtOPT);
%
%     PRESSRMS =
%
%     1.1465
%
%     eXV =
%
%     1.5700
%    -0.8006
%     0.6003
%    -0.8006
%     1.5700
%
% Results may change for different "srgtOPT" structure.
