function yhat = srgtsRBFEvaluate(x,srgtSRGT)
%Function srgtsRBFEvaluate is used to predict the response of a radial
%basis function model. Thus, for example:
%
%     YHAT = srgtsRBFEvaluate(X, SURROGATE): returns the response YHAT
%     predicted by the radial basis function model SURROGATE at all X
%     sites. X can be either a single row vector (single point, with each
%     column representing a variable) or a matrix (each row represents a
%     point). YHAT is an NBPOINTS-by-1 vector.
%
%Example:
%     % basic information about the problem
%     myFN = @cos;  % this could be any user-defined function
%     designspace = [0;     % lower bound
%                    2*pi]; % upper bound
%
%     % create DOE
%     npoints = 5;
%     X = linspace(designspace(1), designspace(2), npoints)';
%
%     % evaluate analysis function at X points
%     Y = feval(myFN, X);
%
%     % fit surrogate models
%     options = srgtsRBFSetOptions(X, Y);
% 
%     surrogate = srgtsRBFFit(options);
%
%     % create test points
%     Xtest = linspace(designspace(1), designspace(2), 100)';
%
%     % evaluate surrogate at Xtest
%     Yhat = srgtsRBFEvaluate(Xtest, surrogate);
%
%     plot(X, Y, 'o', ...
%          Xtest, Yhat)
