function X = srgtsPRSCreateGramianMatrix(x, NbVariables, PRSDegree, PRSRemovedIdx)
%Function srgtsPRSCreateGramianMatrix generates the Gramian matrix. Thus, for
%example:
%
%     GRAMIAN = srgtsPRSCreateGramianMatrix(X, NDV, DEGREE): return
%     respective the GRAMIAN of the matrix X, according to the number of
%     design variables given by NDV and the DEGREE of the polynomial
%     response surface.
%
%     GRAMIAN = srgtsPRSCreateGramianMatrix(X, NDV, DEGREE, PRSREMOVEDIDX):
%     performs the same calculations however it eliminates the columns
%     specified in PRSREMOVEDIDX.
%
%Example:
%     % basic information about the problem
%     myFN = @cos;  % this could be any user-defined function
%     designspace = [0;     % lower bound
%                    2*pi]; % upper bound
%
%     % create DOE
%     npoints    = 5;
%     nvariables = 1;
%     X = linspace(designspace(1), designspace(2), npoints)';
%
%     % create the Gramian of X
%     PRSdegree  = 2;
%     GRAMIAN = srgtsPRSCreateGramianMatrix(X, nvariables, PRSdegree)
% 
%     GRAMIAN =

%     1.0000         0         0
%     1.0000    1.5708    2.4674
%     1.0000    3.1416    9.8696
%     1.0000    4.7124   22.2066
%     1.0000    6.2832   39.4784
