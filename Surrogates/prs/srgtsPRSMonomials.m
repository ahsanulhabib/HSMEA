function monomials = srgtsPRSMonomials(inp1, inp2)
%Function srgtsPRSMonomials outputs the vector of monomial used in the
%polynomial. Numbers in the string represent the index of individual
%variables. The constant term is represented by a zero. Variables in a
%monomial are separated by dots.
%
%     MONOMIALS = srgtsPRSMonomials(NDV, PRS_Degree): creates MONOMIALS
%     for the given number of variables NDV and PRS_Degree.
%
%     MONOMIALS = srgtsPRSMonomials(options, surrogate): creates MONOMIALS
%     vector to be used in conjunction with PRS_Beta in surrogate structure
%     to determine the PRS model fitted to data. Each beta coefficient
%     corresponds with a monomial. It also works for structures with
%     multiple surrogates; each surrogate's monomials are in a separate
%     column in the cell array.
%
%Example 1:
%     % basic information about the problem
%     ndv        = 3;
%     PRS_Degree = 2;
%
%     monomials = srgtsPRSMonomials(ndv, PRS_Degree)
%
%     monomials =
%
%     '0'       <- this is the constant term (intercept)
%     '1'       <- x1 term
%     '2'       <- x2 term
%     '3'       <- x3 term
%     '1.1'     <- x1*x1 term
%     '1.2'     <- x1*x2 term
%     '1.3'     <- x1*x3 term
%     '2.2'     <- x2*x1 term
%     '2.3'     <- x2*x3 term
%     '3.3'     <- x3*x3 term
% 
% 
%Example 2:
%     % basic information about the problem
%     myFN = @cos;  % this could be any user-defined function
%     designspace = [0;     % lower bound
%                    2*pi]; % upper bound
%
%     % create DOE
%     npoints = 5;
%     X = linspace(designspace(1), designspace(2), npoints)';
%
%     % evaluate analysis function at X points
%     Y = feval(myFN, X);
%
%     % fit surrogate models
%     options   = srgtsPRSSetOptions(X, Y);
%     surrogate = srgtsPRSFit(options);
%
%     monomials = srgtsPRSMonomials(options, surrogate)
